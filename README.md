 about github 
# In GitHub Desktop, navigate to the Changes view. In the file list, you should see your README.md. The checkbox to the left of the README.md file indicates that the changes you've made to the file will be part of the commit you make. In the future, you might make changes to multiple files but only want to commit the changes you've made to some of the files. If you click the checkbox next to a file, that file will not be included in the commit.
